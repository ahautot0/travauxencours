Erling Bloch had earlier founded, in 1933, the Erling Bloch Quartet, a traditional string quartet comprising Erling Bloch and Lavard Friisholm, violins, Hans Kassow, viola, Torben Anton Svendsen (again), cello.

The Danish String Quartet[edit]

Danish Quartet by Caroline Bittencourt May 2015
This Danish String Quartet made its debut at the Copenhagen Summer Festival in 2002.[11] In 2012, The New York Times selected the quartet’s concert as a highlight of the year, saying the performance featured “one of the most powerful renditions of Beethoven’s Opus 132 String Quartet that I’ve heard live or on a recording.”[12] In 2013, they began a three-year appointment in Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center’s CMS Two Program.[13] The quartet was named as a BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artist for 2013-15.[14]

Since 2007, the group has curated its own annual festival —DSQ-Musikfest— in Nyboder, Copenhagen. 2016 will mark the beginning of Series of Four, the quartet's new concert series in the concert hall of The Royal Danish Academy of Music, Copenhagen.

Violinists Frederik Øland and Rune Tonsgaard Sørensen and violist Asbjørn Nørgaard met as children at a music summer camp where they played both football and music together, eventually making the transition into a serious string quartet in their teens and studying at Copenhagen’s Royal Academy of Music. In 2008, the three Danes were joined by Norwegian cellist Fredrik Schøyen Sjölin. The Danish String Quartet was primarily taught and mentored by Professor Tim Frederiksen and have participated in master classes with the Tokyo and Emerson String Quartets, Alasdair Tait, Paul Katz, Hugh Maguire, Levon Chilingirian and Gábor Takács-Nagy.[15]

Current Members:

Rune Tonsgaard Sørensen (b. 1983), violin
Frederik Øland (b. 1984), violin

Readers’ Opinions
Forum: Classical Music
These four gifted instrumentalists met in a summer music camp in the Jutland region of Denmark when they were in their early teens. They started playing as a quartet simply because they were good pals and had fun.

In 2001, when they were all under 18, with a push from their professor, Tim Frederiksen, at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, they formalized the quartet, still planning to take things slowly. Two years ago, in their New York debut at Scandinavia House on Park Avenue, they impressed not just with their technically adroit and vibrant playing but also with their proudly nationalistic and stimulating program.

It took courage for them to introduce themselves to New York with a gritty 1973 work by a Danish composer, Hans Abrahamsen, which opened the program. Then they gave an arresting account of a quartet by the turn-of-the-century Danish composer Carl Nielsen. They closed with an impassioned yet cogent performance of Brahms's Quartet in C minor.

What came through as well was a sense of camaraderie in their music-making. They really did seem like four fresh-faced and impetuous friends just having a good time.

Their return engagement at Scandinavia House on Thursday offered an opportunity to catch up with their progress and plans.

Carl-Oscar Osterlind, the group's 21-year-old cellist, said that even after successful concerts and competition victories in Scandinavia, Germany and the Netherlands, they were moving cautiously and completing their conservatory training.

"We love to play, and we love each other," he said. "We work a lot harder now then we did at first, and people expect much from us now that we are known in Denmark. But the fact that we started out on our own when we were young friends means everything." They continue to manage the quartet themselves, he added.

They have received attention, and some kidding, for the group's name, which suggests that they are not planning a long career together.

"It's very difficult to find a name," said the violist, Asbjorn Norgaard, 22. Their teacher, Mr. Frederiksen, had played in the respected Danish Quartet, which disbanded some 10 years ago, Mr. Norgaard explained. So partly in homage to the older ensemble and partly from impishness, they called themselves the Young Danish String Quartet.

"At one point we will drop the 'young,' from the name," said the violinist Frederik Oland, 21. "It won't take too long," he added, elbowing the other violinist, Rune Sorensen, who, at 23, is the group's senior member and who does oil painting on the side.

Actually, in the mature field of classical music, where a soprano in her early 30's is still thought of as young, this ensemble could probably keep its name for a good 15 years and still claim truth in labeling.

Scheduling has become more complicated because Mr. Osterlind is completing a degree at the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm, which he entered to study with a cello teacher he reveres. "I am traveling a lot," he said. "But the guys are kind to me and work around my schedule."

Their camaraderie came through again in Thursday's concert. They brought breezy elegance and sly humor to Haydn's genial Quartet in E flat ("The Joke"). When quick riffs and fancy passagework erupted, their playing abounded with cool command and youthful flair. As he dispatched his part, Mr. Osterlind kept looking away from his music stand so he could listen to and smile at his friends. After the Haydn, a vehement and incisive account of Bartok's visionary Fifth Quartet proved that these easygoing colleagues have put in lots of practice time.

Coming from a Scandinavian country has definite financial advantages for young musicians, they said. The academy is state supported and tuition-free, and the quartet has received grants from Danish foundations.

This summer they will begin a two-year project to record the four quartets of Nielsen as well as his String Quintet, in which they will be joined by their mentor, Mr. Frederiksen. The recording will be released by Dacapo, the Danish national label.

If the players' bracing performance of Nielsen's Quartet No. 2 in G minor last week was any indication, this set will be an exciting addition to the catalog. While honoring the work's neo-Romantic idiom, they brought out all its modernistic oddities and animated the stretches of wayward chromatic harmony.

So far, they have avoided programming touchstone works of the repertory, especially the late Beethoven string quartets. To play these intimidating masterpieces in public, they said, you have to have something to add to the legacy of performances. "We will have to get a lot better, both individually and together," Mr. Norgaard said.

This disarming admission represents a prudent artistic choice. Why set yourself up for comparisons in late Beethoven when you can excite your listeners with Bartok and surprise them with Abrahamsen?

After the concert on Thursday, most people in the audience stayed to greet the young Danes at a reception. On this visit, unlike the previous one, they were able to have wine, since they are now past the legal drinking age — though for two of them, just barely.</p>
